				Hello! My name is Caleb. I am a Computer Science 
				Major here at Wheaton College, who hails from the 
				backwoods of Maine. My general hobbies and interests
				are fairly broad, ranging from programming to drag and 
				from gaming to singing.  
			</p>
			<p>
				My interests in the Computer Science world as a whole have
				varied greatly over the years as I've been exposed to more and
				more experiences and information. There's such a vast multitude
				of career choices to pick from that it often feels so overwhelming
				to try and select one.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="http://lexos3.wheatoncollege.edu">Lexos Development Internship</a> was a huge step forward on 
				my path towards learning more about my passion. The hands on experience
				of working with backend vs frontend development, as well as other tasks
				such as server management, gave me a window into the software
				development world that I had never seen before. After seeing what 
				could be created with tens of thousands of lines of code and a team of 
				determined developers, I've found that my passion at the current moment
				is developing web applications, hence my interest in Comp 212.
