            <p>
                My name is Caleb Braddick. 
                I am a recent graduate of Wheaton College (MA), with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in 
                Music Theory.
                I specialize in Full Stack Web Development and in Software Engineering. 
                I am a hardworking and dedicated worker with a broad range of skills
                and knowledge. I am very passionate about coding and I pride myself in writing readable and 
                efficient backend software. 
                <br>
                Potential employers, please take a look at my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>.
                <br>
                For individuals seeking to have me build their website or application, please see my

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from coding and playing video games, I like to sing and write poetry in my free time. I've sung
                in acapella groups in high school and college, and I have a published poem in my college's literary magazine,
